Plugin add a new field **(with js)** on your forms and check if it exists or it is valorized.

To change the name of the honeypot input you will find a settings page under the WordPress tools menu.

1. Upload the plugin files to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress add plugins page directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' page in WordPress.
